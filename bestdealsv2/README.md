# -------------- INITIALIZATION ----------------

┌─── GETTING STARTED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
| |
| 1️⃣ Initialize Packages: Begin by fetching all necessary packages. |
| Execute the following in your terminal: `flutter pub get`. |
| |
| 2️⃣ SDK Version Check: Ensure you have the correct Dart SDK version. |
| [Note]: `The current Dart SDK version is 2.18.6`. |
| [Error]: Might be `t_store requires SDK version >=3.0.5 <4.0.0`. |
| This indicates version solving has failed due to a mismatch. |
| [Solution]: Upgrade Flutter - To rectify SDK version mismatches and stay updated, |
| run: `flutter upgrade`. This command will fetch and install all the required updates. |
| |
| 3️⃣ Lastly, ensure all dependencies are properly set. |
| Execute `flutter pub get`. |
| On successful completion, you're primed and ready to launch the application. |
